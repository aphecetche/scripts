# Using multipass and spack to get a working environment

## Multipass installation

Head to [multipass](https://multipass.run) homepage and follow the instrutions there to install the multipass product.

## Virtual machine installation

Execute the following command :

```shell
$ ./create-vm.sh
Launched: qqbar2mumu
==> Fetching file:///home/ubuntu/mirror/build_cache/_pgp/0BB2598DB7BB50156663C3C8625B32CA90BA8870.pub
gpg: key 625B32CA90BA8870: public key "Laurent Aphecetche (GPG created for Spack) <laurent.aphecetche@gmail.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: inserting ownertrust of 6
```

It should take of the order of ten minutes (depending on your network connection speed) to complete.

Note that the public key hash will be different from the output above.

Check that the virtual machine has been created :

```shell
$ multipass list
Name                    State             IPv4             Image
qqbar2mumu              Running           172.16.81.14     Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
```

## Virtual machine usage to start a Jupyter Lab server

The main use case for that virtual machine is to launch a Jupyter Lab server ,
which can be done using the `start` convenience command that's defined in that
vm for you :

    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://172.16.81.14:8888/lab?token=282695122119c7cd9c16e096303a3290e387a9792bbafa8a

```

Click (or copy and paste, depending on your terminal capabilities) on the `http://172.../lab?token=....`  to enter a fully functional Jupyter Lab server which gets all (or almost all) the Python modules you'll need to complete the project.

## Doing more with the virtual machine

Occasionally you may need to use it for other things (e.g. to download the
 data), in which case you'll need to "enter" the vm :

```shell
$ multipass shell qqbar2mumu

### Using python packages

If you want to use Python packages the first thing you'll probably want to do is to enter the `qqbar2mumu-2021` environment and load the corresponding packages :

```shell
cd ~/nantes-m2-rps-exp/qqbar2mumu-2021
spacktivate . 
spack load qqbar2mumu-2021
```

### Downloading data

If you just want to download the full (real) data set, do :

```shell
cd ~/nantes-m2-rps-exp/qqbar2mumu-2021
./copy-data-locally.sh
```
